# Asteroids

The game Asteroids, coded in Python, using PyGame Python modules.  
To start the game, first download the repo.  
From the command line, from within the folder where it's unpacked, run `python main.py`.

## Game improvements:

✅ Added a scoring system, so a high score gets saved after player dies  
✅ Added sound to player every time they fire a shot

## Future game improvements to work on by priority (highest to lowest):

Asteroids and player, when they go off screen, have to spawn on the opposite side  
Title screen with interesting fonts, and instructions on controls  
Implement multiple lives and respawning. Player has 3 lives in a game session  
Add an explosion effect for the asteroids  
Add acceleration to the player movement  
Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing  
Add a background image  
Add background music, with the option to turn it off by pressing 'M'  
Create different weapon types  
Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round  
Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one  
Add a shield power-up  
Add a speed power-up -> you can use the code you wrote to color the ship temporarily  
Add bombs that can be dropped  
Refactor code to be more efficient  
A way to store the highest 10 scores, and person puts in their initials when they're dead
